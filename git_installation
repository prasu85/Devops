Get installation software from git-scm.com

Command to install git is 

$ yum install git 

$git --version
To check the version of the git installed in the system.

Then we will configure the global configuration variables to know who did the 
modifications in the code.

$ git config --global user.name "Prasanna"
$ git config --globale user.email "margani.devops@gmail.com"
 
To get the global configuration list the command is 

$ git config --list

To get help from git 

$ git help config sysntax:[git help <verb>]
or
$ git config --config


To start tracking a project we should initialize the directory to git.
command is

$ git init 

To check the status of a project 

$ git status

If we want to ignore the file in the repository from git we can ignore them by creating .gitignore file and write the name in this file. Those files will be ignored.

$ touch .gitignore

In git there will be three stages they are 

1) Working Directory
2) Staging Area
3) .git directory (Repository)

If we want to add files to staging area the command is 

$ git add <file_name>

If we have more than one file and we want to add them all at a time we can use

$ git add -A

If we want to remove from staging area without commiting. We can use

$ git reset

To commit the files/changes those are in staging area. Command is

$ git commit -m "Write what you have done here"

Note:
When we run the command $ git status 
Then the output is On branch master nothing to commit, working directory clean. 
Then there nothing to commit or nochanges have made to our code.

$ git log
 
It shows the what are all the commit made in the repository by generating a unique commit # value

If we have an remote repository exiting already and we want to workon it. Then we will download the remote repository by making a clone of the existing repository. The syntax for that is 

$ git clone <url> <where to clone>


If we want to view the information about the remote repository. Following is the syntax.

$ git remote -v
 
$ git branch -a :To get the branches in the local machine aswell as remote branches.

$ git diff : To get the changes information of the code.
